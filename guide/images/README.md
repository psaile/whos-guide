# Diagrams

The diagrams in this directory are designed using draw.io.

The diagrams are saved as an editable .png file, for easy default viewing on GitHub, showing the last active diagram when saved. Any PNG viewer will also render the diagram in the same way.

The diagrams can be updated using diagrams.net in the following manner:

open files on this GitHub repository directly in diagrams.net
clone this repository, edit/save using the diagrams.net desktop application (download), and commit/push files to GitHub
